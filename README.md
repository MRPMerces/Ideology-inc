# Ideology-inc
This project (Ideology-inc) was started as a school project for the course DFGR3100-1 21H This course ran on the University of South Easter Norway, autumn 2021.
For the bachelor course in computer engineering.

Ideology-inc is based loosely on another game called project porcupine, made by the youtuber Quill18, which is an open-source base version of a base building game.

Ideology-inc started by downloading the part of project porcupine titled as episode 57.
This is an outdated version, however, the features added later was unnecessary for Ideology-inc.
When that was done, the entire downloaded repository was rewritten to clean it up, remove unnecessary functionality and change it based on our needs.
Since then, most of this original code has been redone and most of the sprites replaced. In addition to a lot of content added.
The plan was to rewrite the rest of the original source code from project porcupine as it wasnâ€™t modular enough for us to implement all the features we wanted to add.
However, lack of time halted this.

Some of the sprites in Ideology-inc are sourced from project porcupine.
